            This video leads to a series that discusses ethical considerations in web development, 
            including how developers should make decisions that respect user privacy, 
            fairness, and transparency. It explains why ethics matter when writing code 
            that affects real users and how ethical lapses can harm people and erode trust. 
            The video helped me understand that good web development isn't just about functionality, 
            but also about responsibility and user well-being.

              Ethical Practices in Web Development: A Guide
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            This article explains important ethical practices in web development and 
            why developers should think about how their work affects users. 
            It talks about respecting people's privacy, keeping their information safe, and 
            making websites easy to use for everyone, including people with disabilities. 
            The article also explains how making ethical choices helps build trust with users 
            and keeps websites more secure while following the law. Reading this helped me understand 
            that being ethical is not optional for developers, but something they are expected to do. 
            Overall, this resource showed me that good web design should be fair, honest, and focused on 
            respecting users.
